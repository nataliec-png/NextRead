# NextRead

## Description 

I'm tired of having to spend so much time searching through my goodreads and local library website to figure out what I'm going to read next! This project aims to streamline this process. Given a goodreads username and public book list this program will let you know which books are avaible at the Austin Public Library. Once I get a hold on this I'll try to make it possible for any library. 

## Process 

1. Need to make a webscraper for goodreads since they closed their public API :dissapointed:

2. Uttilize Libby/Overdrive API to see if a book is avaible or not

This is an oversimplification of what I need to do but it'll do for now...
